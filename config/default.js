/**
 * List of plugin repositories.

 *  When resolving plugin dependencies, the plugin manager will try to find a
 * JS file with the name of the plugin under each of these URLs. It will load
 * the first one it finds. Must include trailing slash if you want to directly
 * load JS files (as opposed to use a PHP script to serve the plugins, for
 * example).
 *
 * Each entry can either be a URL or an object containing the following
 * base properties:
 *
 *  - type: string identifying the repository type, default is 'plain'. See
 *    below for possible values
 *  - suffix: string that will be appended to the plugin name (optional,
 *    defaults to `.js`), may be ignored depending on the repository type
 *
 * Additionally, each repository type can define further properties. The
 * possible repository types are:
 *
 *  - plain: plain HTTP(s) repository. Additional properties:
 *    - url: base URL for the repository
 *  - local: local repository. Additional properties:
 *    - plugins: mapping of plugin name to plugin code (string or function)
 *  - github: GitHub repository. Plugins must be organized like
 *    /${path}/auth/plugin-name.js in the repository. Additional
 *    properties:
 *    - repository: GitHub repository identifier, i.e. username/repoName
 *    - version: commit, tag, or branch within the repository, defaults to
 *      `master`
 *    - path: path to the repository root within the GitHub repository, no
 *      leading slash (optional, defaults to `src`)
 *
 * Plugins are loaded as text via $.ajax and then executed in a
 * new Function() context that receives a HBInit function, which can be used to
 * get a room instance like in a vanilla headless script.
